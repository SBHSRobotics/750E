Team 750Evolution's Robot Code

Each folder in the root directory corresponds to a full competition season. Projects in the Skyrise and NBN folders are PROS Eclipse projects, and must be initialized as PROS projects if imported into atom (With the exception of the RobotC code from NBN). All projects from the Starstruck season were created or ported to PROS Atom.
